          <h2>1. Introduction to Marine Biodiversity</h2>
          <p>
            The ocean covers more than 70% of Earth’s surface, and it is teeming
            with life. Marine biodiversity encompasses not only large
            vertebrates like fish, whales, and dolphins but also numerous
            microscopic organisms that form the base of the marine food web.
            Each species plays a vital role—some maintain healthy coral reefs,
            while others filter water or recycle nutrients.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/marine-species.jpg"
            alt="A diverse underwater scene depicting various fish and corals"
            class="content-image"
          />
          <p>
            Sadly, human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate
            change continue to threaten marine biodiversity. Efforts to protect
            and restore marine habitats are essential if we are to secure the
            ocean’s natural treasures and the services they provide.

        <!-- Coral Reefs Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="coralReefs">
          <h2>2. Coral Reefs</h2>
          <p>
            Coral reefs are sometimes described as the “rainforests of the sea,”
            owing to their incredible richness in species. Despite covering less
            than 1% of the ocean floor, coral reefs support about 25% of all
            known marine species. They provide shelter, breeding grounds, and
            nourishment for countless organisms, from tiny shrimp to large
            predatory fish.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/coral-reef.jpg"
            alt="Colorful coral reef teeming with diverse fish species"
            class="content-image"
          />
          <p>
            Reefs also protect coastlines from erosion by acting as natural
            breakwaters. However, factors like ocean acidification and coral
            bleaching pose significant threats to these fragile ecosystems.
            Conservation efforts, such as coral transplantation and the
            establishment of marine protected areas, are key to safeguarding
            coral reefs for future generations.

        <div class="content-section" id="whaleSharks">
          <h2>3. Whale Sharks</h2>
          <p>
            Whale sharks are the largest fish in the sea, reaching lengths of up
            to 40 feet or more. Despite their massive size, these gentle giants
            are filter feeders, primarily dining on plankton and tiny fish.
            Sightings of whale sharks often become major tourist attractions,
            highlighting how marine biodiversity can contribute to local
            economies.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/whale.webp"
            alt="A whale shark swimming in clear blue waters"
            class="content-image"
          />
          <p>
            However, these magnificent creatures are vulnerable to habitat loss,
            boat strikes, and entanglement in fishing gear. Conservation
            programs around the world are focused on tagging and tracking whale
            sharks to learn more about their migratory paths, enabling better
            protection efforts and international collaboration.

        <!-- Mangrove Ecosystems Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="mangroves">
          <h2>4. Mangrove Ecosystems</h2>
          <p>
            Mangroves are coastal forests found in tropical and subtropical
            regions. These unique ecosystems are characterized by salt-tolerant
            trees and are home to a wide array of species, including crabs,
            fish, and birds. Mangroves also act as nurseries for many marine
            organisms, providing a safe environment for juvenile fish to grow
            before venturing out to coral reefs and open waters.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/mangrooves.jpg"
            alt="Dense mangrove roots in shallow coastal waters"
            class="content-image"
          />
          <p>
            Besides supporting biodiversity, mangrove forests protect shorelines
            from storms and mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon in
            their extensive root systems. Unfortunately, mangrove habitats are
            often cleared for urban development or aquaculture. Sustainable
            coastal management practices are essential for preserving these
            vital ecosystems.

        <!-- Marine Protected Areas Section -->
        <div class="content-section" id="marineProtectedAreas">
          <h2>5. Marine Protected Areas</h2>
          <p>
            Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are sections of the ocean where human
            activities are managed or restricted to safeguard natural or
            cultural resources. MPAs can range from small, community-managed
            reserves to vast ocean sanctuaries. By limiting fishing,
            development, and other disturbances, MPAs help restore fish
            populations, protect habitats, and preserve biodiversity hotspots.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/Marine-protected-areas-Map.png"
            alt="A map outline illustrating a designated Marine Protected Area"
            class="content-image"
          />
          <p>
            Although the global coverage of MPAs has increased in recent years,
            many marine regions remain unprotected or poorly managed. Ensuring
            effective governance, enforcement of regulations, and collaboration
            with local communities are essential to the success of MPAs. By
            expanding and effectively managing these areas, we can create
            sustainable models that balance human use with ecological
            preservation.
